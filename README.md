FIX Protocol Message Transformer
--------------------------------
InFIX is a FIX Protocol Message transformer tool that allows financial trading applications to address and transform data in a FIX messages in constant time by applying rules defined in an easy to use text language.

This feature allows FIX connectivity hubs, trading systems, and exchanges to define sets of data transformations outside of application code and apply them at runtime. Because data and rules are independent, applications can define new rules dynamically and apply them without a code release.

InFIX greatly reduces the number of code releases needed when on-boarding new FIX clients, reduces the on-boarding time considerably and allows support personnel to establish connectivity with diverse requirements without developer involvement.

Building the app
----------------
Install Gradle from https://gradle.org
Infix is tested with version 1.11
It may not work with the latest 2.x.x version.
This would be a great thing to do next.
